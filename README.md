# Mario
This program loads in mario with 2 pipes and a couple of goombas. In this program you can press ctrl to shooot fireballs. The fireballs will interact with the goombas and set them on fire, after an amount of time the goomba will dissapear  from the screen.
Mario can run and jump over the tubes. Mario cannot run through the tubes, however he can run through the goombas.
The map will move with mario as he moves, Mario appears to be moving, but really everything on the map is moving in relation to mario, so mario always stays on the same point on the screen.
